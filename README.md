# About recover iTunes

This small Lua-based utility recovers meta-tag data from audio tracks that were legally purchased on the iTunes store. It will:

* scan a directory of untagged M4A tracks, typically from the iPhone's `/Purchases` directory, mounted via [libimobiledevice](http://www.libimobiledevice.org)
* fetch their meta-data from iTunes' [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org) database, located at `/iTunes_Control/iTunes/MediaLibrary.sqlitedb`
* fetch any cover art from `/iTunes_Control/iTunes/Artwork/Originals/`
* save a copy of each renamed track with its embedded meta-data


## Rationale

iTunes keeps track meta-data in its own separate database so audio files are not just devoid of any identifiable information, they'll have unhelpful filenames such as "-49907963407597370.m4a"

This program recovers the following meta-data:

* title
* artist
* album
* track number
* cover art bitmap
* modification/purchase date

It handles UTF-8 characters (including accents) and filters-out illegal characters in POSIX filenames


F.ex., [Clementine](https://www.clementine-player.org/) will go from something like:
![before](https://github.com/kluete/recover_itunes/blob/master/doc/bf.png "before")

To:
![after](https://github.com/kluete/recover_itunes/blob/master/doc/af.png "after")



## Target Audience

This may be of interest to:

* Linux desktop users who purchase music via their iOS device's iTunes store
* want to enjoy those tracks on any platform they see fit (f.ex. I use my [own music player](http://www.laufenberg.ch/lxmusic/) on Debian/Xfce)
* can't run iTunes on Linux or don't like running it on other platforms
* like to mitigate iTunes' instability wrt library zaps
* find audio fingerprinting lacking, especially for more underground artists

As well as anyone curious about iTunes' SQLite schema.



## Requirements

* [Lua 5.3](http://github.com/lua) because its 64-bit integers can handle SQLite indices as-is
* either
  * the command-line [sqlite3](https://packages.debian.org/jessie/sqlite3) binary
  * **OR** a native [Lua SQLite](https://github.com/LuaDist2/lsqlite3) dynamic library built for Lua 5.3
* [AtomicParsely](https://github.com/wez/atomicparsley) to write MP4 meta-tags

On Debian you'd do something like

    apt-get install lua5.3 sqlite3 atomicparsley



## Usage

    sqltunes.lua <in_dir> <itunes_db_dir> <out_dir>



## Example

After having mounted your iPhone on Linux via [libimobiledevice](http://www.libimobiledevice.org):

    # retrieve mount point
    myiosroot=$(mount -t fuse.gvfsd-fuse | cut -d ' ' -f3)"/afc:host="$(ideviceinfo -k UniqueDeviceID)
    # run
    lua5.3 sqltunes.lua $myiosroot/Purchases $myiosroot/iTunes_Control/iTunes out



## Technical details

* this program is **read-only** -- no data whatsoever is written to the iPhone
* it is *theoretically* possible to retrieve meta-data from tracks in the global iTunes library (i.e. outside the `/Purchases` directory) but this program isn't designed for it. In a large audio library you're likely to encounter multiple tracks with the same (short) filename, in different sub-directories, which this program doesn't currently handle. Not much point anyway since you likely already have them elsewhere with full meta-data
* reading files directly via FUSE's AFC protocol over USB can be slow. To speed it up, copy relevant iOS files to your HDD first, then process them locally
* if you have several iOS devices (concurrently or at different times), make sure to process one device at a time and not to mix up their files; the same audio track will have different (source) filenames/checksums, i.e. looking up a track from device A with the database from device B will likely fail. 
* there's currently a hardcoded (hackish) 31-year timestamp offset for the purchase date, maybe because the **Julian calendar** starts on 19-December-1969
* ffmpeg/avconv don't seem to correctly handle m4a cover art
* a native Lua SQLite library is really only needed for development/debugging. For plain usage, CLI sqlite3 is suffficient



## Fineprint & Cop-out

* although a trigger-happy lawyer will no doubt find *something* to scream bloody murder about, there's no real hacking going on here. iTunes' database is stored in the vanilla, open-source SQLite format and retrieving a track's meta-data comes down to a single, albeit tortuous, `SELECT` statement (this cop-out kind of moot after publication in [Hackaday.com] (http://hackaday.com/2016/07/21/ever-buy-music-from-apple-use-linux-you-need-this-tool/) )
* do not try to write modified files back to iOS manually; at best iTunes will ignore them, at worst you'll corrupt the database
* if your desktop audio player is iTunes anyway, stick to it
* iTunes stores all sorts of data inside audio files, with some debate about standard-compliance; no attempt is made here to address those issues 
* use at your own risk
* please share any fixes/improvement
* enjoy!
